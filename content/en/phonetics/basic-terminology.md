# Basic Terminology

Here I will explain the absolute basics to get started with phonetics, enjoy!

## 1. Vowels

Vowels refers to speech sounds that are realized without a proper obstruction of the vocal tract. In other words, when we pronounce vowels, our articulatory organs are relatively open.There are 3 main things we talk about when it comes to vowels.

1. Vowel height
2. Vowel backness
3. Rounding

Vowel height refers to how much the tongue is raised when articulating a certain vowel. Vowel backness is the horizontal position of the tongue, where the tongue is raised. Rounding is how much the lips round during the articulation of a certain vowel.

### Japanese Vowel Chart

|             |       |         |      |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
|             | Front | Central | Back |
| High(Close) | い     |         | う    |
| Mid         | え     |         | お    |
| Low(Open)   |       | あ       |      |

For example, い is classified as a high front vowel because the tongue is raised up and is in the front part of the mouth during articulation.

## 2. Consonants

Consonants are speech sounds in which the air is obstructed in some way. May it be an absolute obsturction (stops/plosives) may it be an incomplete but very narrow obstruction (fricatives).

We can clasify Japanese consonants into the following table.

The table is made so that we start at the front of the mouth (lips – labia) and continue further up to the the glottis.

Let's start from the manner of articulation.

## 3. Manner of articulation

Manner of articulation refers to the interaction between articulatory organs when producing a certain speech sound. The question we should ask ourselves when talking about the manner of articulation is "How is the air released?".

### Nasal consonants

- These consonants are articulated with the passage to the nasal cavity open – the air passes through the nose because of a lowered velum.
