## 1. Vowels

Vowels refers to speech sounds that are realized without a proper obstruction of the vocal tract. In other words, when we pronounce vowels, our articulatory organs are relatively open.There are 3 main things we talk about when it comes to vowels.

1. Vowel height
2. Vowel backness
3. Rounding

Vowel height refers to how much the tongue is raised when articulating a certain vowel. Vowel backness is the horizontal position of the tongue, where the tongue is raised. Rounding is how much the lips round during the articulation of a certain vowel.
